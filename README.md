# EPQ-Project
This is the repositry for the game I created in Unity with C# for my Extended Project Qualification (EPQ). I worked on this during 2017 and 2018. It inlcudes the final report I wrote as well as a link to the presentation that I created to demonstrate my project.

*Since I have only recently created this Github account, The source files for this project have not been added to this repositry yet, as they are stored on a backup that I don't have physical access to at the moment. They will be available from 11th December when I have access again. Feel free to have a look at the report I wrote for this project in the mean time.*
