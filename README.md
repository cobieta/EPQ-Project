# EPQ-Project
This is the repositry for the game I created in Unity with C# for my Extended Project Qualification (EPQ). I worked on this during 2017 and 2018. It inlcudes the final report I wrote. To play the game, please download the correct EPQ game build folder for your system (either the x64 or x86 one). To view the Unity project files, check the EPQ game folder. 

This is a link to the presentation that I created to demonstrate my project and includes video footage of my game:
